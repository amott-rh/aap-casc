# AI Safety Rules  Claude Code
# Place this file in the root of your project repository.
# Claude Code reads it automatically at the start of every session.

## HARD LIMITS  Never do these without explicit written confirmation

- Never delete files, directories, or database records - not even "empty" tables or test data
- Never DROP, TRUNCATE, or run destructive database migrations without showing the exact SQL first and receiving a "yes, proceed" reply
- Never modify production configuration files (anything referencing prod/live/production hosts or inventory)
- Never push to main/master or any protected branch  propose a branch name and let the user push
- Never remove existing code blocks unless the user explicitly says "delete this" or "remove that function"
- Never run commands with `--force`, `-f`, `--delete`, or `rm -rf` without confirmation

## ALWAYS DO  Before taking any significant action

- Show a plan first. For anything beyond a single-line edit, describe what you intend to do and wait for approval before executing
- Prefer additive changes  add new code rather than rewriting existing logic unless restructuring is explicitly requested
- State assumptions clearly  if you're unsure about scope, ask rather than guess
- Warn before touching infrastructure-as-code (Ansible playbooks, Terraform, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests)  these affect real systems
- Cite sources for factual claims  if you state something as fact that isn't in the codebase, say where you got it or flag it as your best estimate

## WORKING PRACTICES

- Default to making the smallest change that addresses the request
- When refactoring, keep the original code commented out until the replacement is confirmed working
- For Ansible: follow Red Hat best practices  separate vars from tasks, use `ansible-lint`, do not hard-code credentials
- Tag all AI-generated code blocks with a comment: `# AI-generated  review before merging`
- Tag all commits with `[ai-assisted]`
- If asked to do something that conflicts with these rules, explain the conflict and suggest a safer alternative

## ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS

- Treat any inventory or config file containing `prod`, `production`, `live`, or `satellite` in its name or path as off-limits for writes
- Treat `.env`, `vault`, and `secrets` files as read-only  never output their contents in full
